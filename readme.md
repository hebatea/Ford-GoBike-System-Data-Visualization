# Ford GoBike System Data
## by Heba Ashour


## Dataset

The data consisted of containing information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system for 183412 rides. The attributes included features that related to trips (start_day, start_hour, duration_hours) and other related to members (member_age, user_type: Subscriber or Customer, member_gender, bike_share_for_all_trip).

## Summary of Findings

I discovered the following points:
1. The **Subscriber** user type percent is larger than **Customer**.
2. The user use the bikes mostly in the work days(Thursday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Monday), and use it less in the weekends(Saturday, and Sunday)
3. The user use the the bike in work hours going, and leave (8 AM - 17=(5 PM)), (9 AM - 18=(6 PM)) etc...
4. The customers do not share bike for all trips, and subscriber users mostly do not share bike for all trips.
5. The mean duration_munites for Customers is larger than Subscribers.
6. The duration of miuntes is decrease when the age of the member become larger.
7. The longest trip duration(minutes) on Saturday and Sunday for Customer and Subscriber, and that could explains why the number of trips in this day are the smallest.
8. The shortest trip duration(minutes) on Tuesday and Thursday for Customer and Subscriber, and that could explains why the number of trips in these day are the highest.
9. The Subscirber users are older than the Customer users.
10. The females in Customer and Subscriber has the smallest age.


## Key Insights for Presentation

I used the following points in explanatory stage:
1. The **Subscriber** user type percent is larger than **Customer**.
2. The user use the bikes mostly in the work days(Thursday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Monday), and use it less in the weekends(Saturday, and Sunday)
3. The mean duration_munites for Customers is larger than Subscribers.
4. The longest trip duration(minutes) on Saturday and Sunday for Customer and Subscriber, and that could explains why the number of trips in this day are the smallest.
8. The shortest trip duration(minutes) on Tuesday and Thursday for Customer and Subscriber, and that could explains why the number of trips in these day are the highest.

I have polised the figures by adding titles, labels, and using right colors.
